##### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
      An intelligent crop protection system helps the farmers in protecting the crop
      from the animals and birds which destroy the crop. This system also helps farmers 
      to monitor the soil moisture levels in the field and also the temperature and humidity 
      values near the field. The motors and sprinklers in the field can be controlled using 
      the mobile application.
